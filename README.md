Simple React Starter--------- NOPE It's only memes here. JK idk I guess you can use this as a starter it's pretty dope.


### Adding a meme

- Add memes to `staging` folder
- Run `flushStaging.js` script in `scripts`, this adds the correct name to to the `enumerated` meme directory
- Run `gulp thumbnails` to generate thumbnails
- Run aws sync for thumbnails and thumbnail directory
- Add entry to database in `database/db.json`
- Meme will now be available in next deployment
